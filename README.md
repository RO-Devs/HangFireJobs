# HangFireJobs
This is a project to learn how to make Scheduled jobs agent in a web app and user interface. 

In order to connect to same DB as me, you have to download the AdventureWorks2019 database backup from here:
 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms
 
 Restore that database in your pc and test it. 
 
 
 To setup the HangFire you must read the documentation file here
